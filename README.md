# Real-Time Raw ADC Data Processing and Visualization Tool for TI mmWave Radar

## Overview

This project provides a real-time radar data capture and processing pipeline for TI mmWave radar sensors using the DCA1000EVM and a Python-based software stack ‚Äî without relying on TI's mmWave Studio. It streams and processes raw ADC data directly from compatible radar devices and presents the output in intuitive live visualizations.

Traditional workflows with mmWave Studio are limited to file-based offline processing and require multiple dependencies, specific software versions, and complex configuration steps. This tool bypasses those limitations by enabling live UDP data capture, multi-threaded signal processing, and interactive GUI-based visualization.

</p>

## üõ† Expected Hardware Compatibility

This tool is designed and tested for the **AWR1843AOP mmWave radar sensor** and **DCA1000EVM**, but it is expected to work with other TI AWR and IWR series sensors supported by the DCA1000 interface.

**Examples include:**
- AWR1243, AWR1443, AWR1642, AWR2243, AWR2944, AWR6843, AWR6843AOP
- IWR1443, IWR1642, IWR1843, IWR2944, IWR6843, IWR6843AOP

‚ö†Ô∏è **While not all devices are explicitly tested, compatibility is expected based on shared interface and data capture protocols. Ensure your radar is supported by the DCA1000EVM and outputs raw ADC via LVDS.**

## üöß Motivation

Setting up real-time raw ADC capture with mmWave Studio often involves:
- Complex DIP switch configurations and unclear hardware instructions
- Platform-specific dependencies (Windows-only, MATLAB runtime)
- Fragmented documentation across toolboxes, user guides, and forums
- No support for live processing ‚Äî only offline .bin analysis

This project addresses those limitations by providing:
- A streamlined setup (Python + Ethernet + config file)
- A user-friendly interface with parameter control and diagnostics
- A fully extensible signal processing pipeline for education, prototyping, and research

### Drivers Installation

#### Installation of FTDI and XDS driver

#### FTDI Drivers for DCA1000

FTDI (Future Technology Devices International) drivers are software components that allow an operating system to communicate with FTDI chips, which are commonly used for USB-to-serial (UART) and other USB bridge connections.

**Types of FTDI Drivers:**
- **VCP (Virtual COM Port):** Emulates a standard serial port on the PC, allowing legacy software to communicate with devices as if they are connected by traditional RS232/COM ports
- **D2XX:** Provides direct access to the USB device without creating a COM port. Used by custom applications needing more control or performance
- **D3XX:** Used for higher-speed USB3.0 chips (not common with DCA1000)

‚Ä¢ USB-to-Serial Interface: The DCA1000EVM integrates an FTDI chip (such as the FT4232) to implement its USB-to-serial (UART) interface. This lets the host computer connect to the DCA1000EVM using a standard USB cable.

‚Ä¢ Driver Requirement: For the PC to recognize and communicate with the DCA1000EVM's UART interface, the correct FTDI driver (most commonly the VCP driver) must be installed. When installed, the DCA1000 will appear as a COM port in the Device Manager.

Open Windows Device Manager and expand the "Ports (COM & LPT)" list for confirming hardware detection. When the DCA1000 + AWR1843AOPEVM is connected to the PC and switched ON for the first time, Windows may not be able to recognize the device and it may show up under "Other devices" in Device Manager. The FTDI device ports of the DCA1000 board will appear with a yellow label when the driver is not installed.

<p align="center">
<img width="468" height="236" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a3deb0c-ebcd-4640-8a1c-95d91fc5957b" />
</p>

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Download the latest FTDI CDM driver** from the [FTDI website](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/) and unzip it into a location on your PC

2. **Run the FTDI driver exe** with administrator privileges and follow the installation wizard

3. **Verify Installation:** Open Windows Device Manager and expand the "Ports (COM & LPT)" list. When properly installed, you should see 4 new COM ports without yellow warning labels.

**Troubleshooting FTDI Installation:**
- If devices still appear with yellow labels, try downloading and installing mmWave Studio from [TI.com](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-STUDIO). The required FTDI drivers will be installed automatically at the end of mmWave Studio installation.

<p align="center">
<img width="785" height="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a63f16af-e8c6-45d0-b29e-6e2c08fd7fa1" />
</p>

- If the automatic FTDI installation fails, in Windows Device Manager right-click on these devices and update the drivers by pointing to the location of the FTDI driver.

<p align="center">
<img width="696" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce981dba-9b72-4554-80ca-c1b3edec6680" />
<p align="center">

- This must be done for all four COM ports. If after updating the FTDI driver, Device Manager still does not show 4 new COM Ports, update the FTDI driver once again.

<p align="center">
  
-    When all four COM ports are installed, Device Manager recognizes these devices and indicates the COM port numbers.

#### Silicon Labs USB-to-UART Driver for AWR1843AOP

The CP210x series from Silicon Labs consists of USB-to-UART bridge chips that play a crucial role in connecting TI mmWave radar sensors to host computers.

Here's how they are related:

- TI mmWave radar sensors use UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) interfaces for configuration and data transfer. Many TI radar evaluation modules have built-in USB-to-UART bridges so they can easily connect to a PC using a USB cable.
- CP210x chips are the USB-to-UART bridge used on many TI mmWave radar sensor boards (such as IWR and AWR series EVMs). The CP210x device converts USB from the host PC into the UART protocol used by the radar hardware. This enables:
  - Flashing firmware to the radar sensor.
  - Sending configuration commands.
  - Receiving radar data as a serial stream.
- Drive Requirements: For the serial (COM) ports of TI mmWave radar sensors to function correctly on a computer, the Silicon Labs CP210x drivers must be installed. When properly installed, the system will detect one or more serial ports (COM ports) corresponding to the radar sensor‚Äôs UART channels‚Äîthese are recognized as "Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge" ports in the device manager.

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Download the CP210x Universal Windows Drivers** from [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)

2. **Right-click the folder** and unzip the installation files

3. **Right-click on the silabser.inf file** and select Install

4. **Follow the installation wizard**, click the "Next" button, and agree with the terms of use to complete the installation process and the CP210x USB drivers will be installed successfully.

## System Architecture

The system is built around a set of core components that are shared across all three processing modes. These components handle the initial setup, data acquisition, and basic configuration of the radar system.

### 1. Launcher (`launcher.py`)
The `launcher.py` script serves as the main entry point for the entire application. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt5 that allows the user to select and launch one of the three radar processing applications. This centralized launcher simplifies the user experience and provides a consistent starting point for all operations.

### 2. Radar Configuration
The radar configuration is handled by a set of files and modules that work together to initialize the radar hardware with the desired parameters.

- **Configuration File (`config/AWR1843_cfg.cfg`):** This is a plain text file that contains a series of commands for configuring the AWR1843AOP EVM. These commands set up the radar's chirp parameters, frame structure, ADC settings, and data output format. The file is parsed by the `radar_parameters.py` module to extract the configuration values.

- **`radar_config.py`:** This module contains the `SerialConfig` class, which is responsible for communicating with the radar EVM over a serial (COM) port. It reads the commands from the .cfg file and sends them to the radar one by one. It also provides methods for starting and stopping the radar sensor.

- **`radar_parameters.py`:** This module defines the `RadarParameters` class, which parses the .cfg file and calculates a set of derived parameters that are essential for the signal processing pipeline. These parameters include:
  - Range resolution
  - Maximum range
  - Velocity resolution
  - Maximum velocity
  - Dimensions of the radar data cube

### 3. Data Acquisition
The data acquisition process is managed by a dedicated thread that receives raw ADC data from the radar and makes it available to the processing pipeline.

- **UdpListener** (in `rp_real_time_process.py`, `rd_real_time_process.py`, `ra_real_time_process.py`): This class, which runs in its own thread, is responsible for listening for UDP packets from the DCA1000 EVM on a specific network port. It receives the raw ADC data, removes the packet headers, and places the binary data into a shared queue for the DataProcessor to consume.

- **Binary Data Queue:** A thread-safe queue that is used to transfer the raw ADC data from the UdpListener to the DataProcessor. This decouples the data acquisition and data processing tasks, allowing them to run in parallel and preventing data loss.

### Processing Pipelines

The system features three distinct processing pipelines, one for each of the supported radar modes. Each pipeline is implemented in its own set of scripts and is responsible for processing the raw ADC data and generating the corresponding visualization.

#### 1. Range Profile
The Range Profile mode provides a 1D visualization of the signal power as a function of distance from the radar.

- **`rp_main.py`:** The main script for the Range Profile application. It initializes the GUI, starts the UdpListener and DataProcessor threads, and handles user interactions.

- **`rp_real_time_process.py`:** Contains the DataProcessor class for this mode. It retrieves raw data from the binary queue, reshapes it, and passes it to the `rp_dsp` module for processing.

- **`rp_dsp.py`:** This module contains the core signal processing functions for the Range Profile mode:
  - **1D FFT:** A Fast Fourier Transform is applied to the ADC data to transform it from the time domain to the frequency domain, which corresponds to the range domain
  - **Pulse Compression:** A matched filter is applied to the data to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through pulse compression
  - **CFAR Detection:** A Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm is used to detect peaks in the range profile, which correspond to detected objects
  - **Clutter Removal:** A static clutter removal algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be applied to remove stationary background objects

- **`rp_app_layout.py`:** Defines the PyQt5 GUI for the Range Profile application. It includes a 1D plot for the range profile, a table to display the range and magnitude of detected objects, and controls for configuring the processing parameters.

#### 2. Range-Doppler
The Range-Doppler mode provides a 2D visualization of the signal power as a function of both range and velocity.

- **`rd_main.py`:** The main script for the Range-Doppler application.

- **`rd_real_time_process.py`:** Contains the DataProcessor for this mode, which calls the `rd_dsp` module for processing.

- **`rd_dsp.py`:** The signal processing module for the Range-Doppler mode:
  - **2D FFT:** A 2D FFT is performed on the radar data cube to generate the Range-Doppler map. The first FFT is along the range dimension, and the second is along the Doppler (chirp) dimension
  - **2D CFAR Detection:** A 2D version of the CFAR algorithm is used to detect objects in the Range-Doppler map
  - **MTI Filtering:** A Moving Target Indicator (MTI) filter can be applied to suppress stationary targets and enhance the detection of moving objects

- **`rd_app_layout.py`:** The GUI for the Range-Doppler application. It features a 2D heatmap for the Range-Doppler map and a data table that displays the range, speed, and direction of detected objects.

#### 3. Range-Angle
The Range-Angle mode provides a 2D visualization of the signal power as a function of range and angle, allowing for the spatial localization of objects.

- **`ra_main.py`:** The main script for the Range-Angle application.

- **`ra_real_time_process.py`:** Contains the DataProcessor for this mode, which calls the `ra_dsp` module for processing.

- **`ra_dsp.py`:** The signal processing module for the Range-Angle mode:
  - **3D FFT:** A 3D FFT is performed on the radar data cube. The first two dimensions compute the Range-Doppler map, and the third dimension (across the virtual antenna array) is used to estimate the angle of arrival
  - **Beamforming:** A beamforming algorithm with steering vectors is used to generate the Range-Angle map for both azimuth and elevation
  - **2D CFAR Detection:** The CFAR algorithm is applied to the Range-Angle map to detect objects

- **`ra_app_layout.py`:** The GUI for the Range-Angle application. It includes a 2D heatmap for the Range-Angle map and a data table that displays the range and angle of detected objects.

- **`coordinate_transforms.py`:** A utility module that provides functions for converting polar coordinates (range and angle) to Cartesian coordinates (x and z) for visualization.
